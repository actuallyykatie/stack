# StackOverflow developer survey analysis

## project 1: will people born today will have a better life than their parents?

**Task**: examine the relationship between belief in whether youth will have better life than their parents and several variables *(no more than 4)* using logistic regression. 

> Do developers think that people born today will have a better life than their parents? 

**Data:** StackOverflow Developer Survey 2019

The following variables were chosen as predictors:

- `Region`  
- `BlockchainIs`  
- `Gender`  
- `Age`


**Methods:** 
- **model:** logistic regression  


**Results:**   

- developers who consider blockchain useful have more optimistic thoughts compared to those with negative attitude  
- region matters as well: most regions had higher odds of belief in better life compared to developers in Northern America  
- gender and age: females and non-binary are more suspicious about the future, as well as people with higher age.
